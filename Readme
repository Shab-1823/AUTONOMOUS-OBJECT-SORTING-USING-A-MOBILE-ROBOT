Autonomous Object Sorting Using a Mobile Robot

Abstract:
This project focuses on creating an autonomous mobile robot (AMR) capable of sorting objects based on color. 
The robot performs this task without human intervention, using sensors and algorithms developed in MATLAB/Simulink and Stateflow. 
The algorithm is designed to make the robot identify colored pucks and sort them into respective zones, achieving autonomy in object sorting. 
The system was tested in a simulated environment, and the trials showed successful puck sorting, with average completion times around 60 seconds.

Introduction:
Autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) can navigate and make decisions based on their environment. 
This project aims to simulate an AMR that sorts colored pucks into designated zones in a 5x5-meter arena. 
The robot starts at a specific location, detects the pucks' color using a color sensor, and moves them to the corresponding colored zone without colliding with the walls.

Theory and Procedure:
The robot moves using four basic operations: turning left, turning right, moving forward, and moving backward. 
A two-dimensional coordinate system is used to define the environment. The process includes:
1. Moving to the first puck, detecting its color, and pushing it to the correct zone.
2. Repeat the process for the second puck and then return to the origin.

Robot Attributes:
- Color detection camera for identifying pucks.
- Three proximity sensors for navigation, ensuring collision avoidance.

Methods and Algorithms:
The project uses a combination of MATLAB functions and Stateflow to modularize the robot's actions. 
The algorithm defines the robot's path based on puck colors and proximity to objects, ensuring smooth and accurate movements.

Results & Discussion:
- Trial 1: Successfully sported a red and sported puck in 73 seconds.
- Trial 2: Sorted another red and blue puck in 81.2 seconds.
- Trial 3: Sorted a red and green puck in 67.6 seconds.
All trials showed no collisions and smooth trajectories. The robot accurately identified puck colors and sorted them into the correct zones.

Conclusion:
The project successfully implemented autonomous sorting, path planning, and collision avoidance in a simulated environment. 
The robot consistently performed the tasks with high accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of the developed algorithm. 
Further improvements could enhance autonomy, allowing the robot to handle more complex tasks.
